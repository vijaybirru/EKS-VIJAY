control plane : master component 


A -API-server -- The API server is a component of the Kubernetes control plane that exposes the Kubernetes API. 
The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane.

The main implementation of a Kubernetes API server is kube-apiserver. 
kube-apiserver is designed to scale horizontallyâ€”that is, it scales by deploying more instances. 
You can run several instances of kube-apiserver and balance traffic between those instances.

C -controller


C -container run time
The container runtime is the software that is responsible for running containers.

Kubernetes supports several container runtimes: Docker, containerd, CRI-O, and any implementation of the Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface).


E -etcd
Consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.

k -kubelet
An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that containers are running in a Pod.

The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs that are provided through various mechanisms and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy. The kubelet doesn't manage containers which were not created by Kubernetes.


s -scheduler
Control plane component that watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on.
